/*
 * (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student
 *  and Employee. 
 * Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address. A student has
 *  a class status
 *  (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. 
 *  Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty member has office hours and 
 *  a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test pro- gram that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty,
 and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
